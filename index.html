  <h1>IMPACT: WHERE AMERICAN GUNS ARE MADE AND SOLD</h1>

  <p>Guns mean big business in America. The industry employs more than 300,000 people, pays roughly $15.4 billion in wages a year and has an overall impact of $51.4 billion on the U.S. economy as of 2017, according to the National Sports Shooting Foundation
    (NSSF).
  </p>

  <p>“Our industry is proud to be one of the truly bright spots in our economy as an unprecedented number of Americans have chosen to exercise their fundamental right to keep and bear arms and to safely enjoy the shooting sports,” said Stephen L. Sanetti,
    NSSF president and CEO, in a statement.
  </p>

  <p>That “bright spot” doesn’t appear to be in decline, data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) reveal.</p>

  <p>In 2016, United States gun makers made history and reported manufacturing nearly 11.5 million firearms, up from the previous record of 10.3 million in 2013. That's the equivalent of more than 30,000 guns a day—enough for 1 out of 25 Americans to receive one.
  </p>

  <p>But where are these guns made, where are they sold and how much money and how many jobs do they contribute to the economy? We can answer these questions through a combination of data
    from the NSSF, ATF, the FBI’s NICS background check system and the U.S. Census Bureau.
  </p>

  <p>“As much as we like to malign the United States, particularly when it comes to the abuse of firearms, it is actually one of the very few countries where we are able to get any sort of data even as the industry tries to make the data not very available,” said Jurgen Brauer, an economist who published a landmark study on US firearms in 2013 with the Small Arms Survey.</p>

  <h1>WHERE ARE GUNS MADE?</h1>

  <p>America’s century-old gun industry has its origins in the northeast, where nine states now churn out more than half of the guns made every year, according to the ATF.</p>

  <p>It all started 13 years before the American Civil War in 1852, when Horace Smith and Daniel Baird Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Massachusetts to make pistols and rifles that could repeatedly fire a fully self-contained cartridge.</p>

  <p>They won a patent two years later in 1854, company records show.</p>

  <p>In 1857, the inventors set up shop in Springfield, Massachusetts and sold their first pistol for $12. Today, Smith & Wesson runs America’s largest gun factory in Springfield, which single-handedly produced 2.1 million of the 2.5 million firearms Massachusetts manufactured in 2016.</p>

  <p>In more than a dozen mid-sized cities and towns like Springfield across the northeast, gun factories are a source of blue-collar, often unionized jobs which haven’t departed for shores with cheaper labor.</p>

  <p>With a population around 150,000 and an unemployment rate nearly double the state’s, Smith & Wesson is the fourth top employer in Springfield and a valued economic presence, said the city’s former chief development officer, David Panagore, in an interview with HuffPost.</p>

  <p>“These industrial cities, these legacy cities around the state, around New England and around the country, have very little future and have been struggling to reinvent themselves,” Panagore said.</p>

  <p>Massachusetts supplies one-fifth of all firearms nationwide thanks mostly to the factory, edging out every other state in the United States by at least ten percent.</p>

  <p>According to the NSSF, gun manufacturing employed nearly 500 people and paid close to $24 million in wages in Massachusetts.</p>

  <p>While across the northeast, the industry employed more than 1,900 people and paid more than $146 million in wages.</p>

  <p>Massachusetts delivered nearly three-fifths of all guns made in the northeast, but it also had help from its neighbors.</p>

  <p>Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Maine and Vermont together supplied more than 2.6 million firearms or 24 percent of the national total.</p>

  <p>Among America’s 100 top gun manufacturing cities in 2016, which accounted for 93% of all manufacturing, 22 cities are in the northeast.</p>

  <h1>THE SOUTH</h1>

  <p>Known for its pro-gun culture, the south was where 3 out of 10 guns—or 3.4 million firearms—were manufactured in 2016, according to the ATF.</p>

  <p>Similar to the northeast, gun manufacturing in the south is concentrated in a few states. Among the 15 states of the south, seven produced 95 percent of all the firearms in the region.</p>

  <p>Florida led gun manufacturing with more than 700,000 firearms, followed closely by Texas with nearly 600,000 guns and Kentucky with 460,000.</p>

  <p>And like the northeast, gun manufacturing in the south is concentrated in specific cities.</o>

  <p>This trend is on full display in Eagle Pass, Texas, which is the biggest supplier of firearms in the south, churning out 14 percent of all guns in the region and 84 percent of guns made in Texas.</p>

  <p>Eagle Pass is home to the Maverick Arms factory owned by America’s largest shotgun manufacturer, Mossberg & Sons, which was founded in 1919 in the northeast state of Connecticut but has recently moved manufacturing to Texas.</p>

  <p>In 2014, the company invested $3.4 million in its Maverick Arms facility, resulting in 50 more manufacturing jobs, the San Antonio Business Journal reported.</p>

  <p>In an interview with Forbes, CEO Iver Mossberg explained why his company invested in Texas instead of its historical operations in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>

  <p>“It’s a state that is not only committed to economic growth but also honors and respects the Second Amendment and the firearm freedoms it guarantees for our customers,” Mossberg said.</p>

  <p>Mossberg & Sons now produces more than 90 percent of its guns in the Lone Star state.</p>

  <p>“We’re moving all wood gun stock production to our Texas facility. More of our product lines—like our modern sporting rifles—might move to Texas in the future,” Mossberg said. “Texas has been very good to us.”</p>

  <p>Gun manufacturing jobs are also more prevalent in southern states like Texas than the northeast, according to the NSSF.</p>

  <p>Despite producing 21 percent fewer guns nationwide than the northeast in 2016, gun manufacturing in the south now employs two times more people than northeast as of 2017, totaling nearly 4,000 jobs and $292 million in wages, according to the ATF and NSSF.</p>

  <p>An NSSF spokesperson said this is because gun manufacturers are moving jobs from less gun-friendly states to more welcoming climates like the south.</p>

  <p>“Firearms makers have been moving out of states with unfriendly business climates and highly restrictive gun laws that do nothing but punish law-abiding citizens to those states with friendlier business climates where state and local officials welcome the high-paying manufacturing jobs,” the spokesperson said.</p>

  <h1>THE WEST</h2>

  <p>The western United States was the third top supplier of guns among the country’s four census regions in 2016, manufacturing 1.4 million firearms or 12 percent of the national total, according to the ATF.</p>

  <p>But among the region’s 13 states, only Arizona produced a significant amount while every other state manufactured less than 2 percent of the national total.</p>

  <p>Arizona supplied close to 940,000 guns, accounting for more than three-fifths of all guns made in the western United States, and 1 out of 25 firearms nationwide.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the guns made in the state came from Prescott, Arizona, which produced 900,000 firearms and hosts a major Sturm, Ruger & Company facility manufacturing pistols.</p>

  <p>In an interview with the Arizona Republic, Kelly McMillan of McMillan Firearms Manufacturing hailed Arizona as “a great state for firearms.”</p>

  <p>“The politics are pro-firearms, and the weather is as good as it gets for making fiberglass gun stocks,” McMillan said.</p>

  <p>Gun manufacturing in Arizona employed more than 300 people and paid $30 million in wages, according to the NSSF.</p>

  <p>Utah was the second top supplier in the south, producing 150,000 guns or 1 out of 10 guns in the region, but the state supplied only 1.30 percent of the gun made in the US overall.</p>

  <p>Like the northeast, the west coast of America is home to more liberal, anti-gun coastal states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>

  <p>Combined, these states didn’t even produce 2 percent of the national total.</p>

  <h1>THE MIDWEST</h1>

  <p>Despite being more gun-friendly than the west or northeast, the midwest manufactured only 7 percent of guns nationwide in 2016, according to the ATF.</p>

  <p>Just three states—Illinois, Ohio and South Dakota—made up 81 percent of the region’s gun manufacturing.</p>

  <p>Three cities in these states stood out as centers of gun manufacturing.</p>

  <p>Sturgis, South Dakota was the number one city for gun manufacturing in the region, producing 185,000 guns or nearly 1 out of 25 of firearms.</p>

  <p>Following closely behind, Geneseo, Illinois produced 160,000 firearms to earn the second top spot in the midwest.</p>

  <p>Mansfield, Ohio was the third top gun producing city with 150,000 firearms.</p>

  <p>But thanks to Ohio’s other gun manufacturing centers in Lima and Cleveland, the state won first place in the midwest, with more than 230,000 firearms produced.</p>

  <h1>OPTICAL ILLUSION?</h1>

  <p>The United States handily distinguishes itself as both the top firearms exporter and manufacturer in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>

  <p>But in an interview, economist Jurgen Brauer said American gun manufacturing isn’t what it appears, likening it to a “visual-optical illusion.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, there still is a lot of manufacturing in the United States, maybe not quite as much as you think or maybe not quite the way that you think,” Brauer said.</p>

  <p>Brauer said that although American factories manufacture millions of guns, many of the components they use come from outside the USA, and data on the number of imported components used in gun factories remain unavailable.</p>

  <p>But according to the US International Trade Commission, the nation imported more than 16 million components for firearms in 2016.</p>

  <p>“Whether or not it is ‘considerable’ we cannot say with any quantitative certainty because we do not know the US numbers,” Brauer said.</p>
