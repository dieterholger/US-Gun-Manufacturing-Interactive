  <h1>MAPPED: WHERE AMERICAN GUNS ARE MADE, SOLD AND THEIR ECONOMIC IMPACT</h1>

  <p>Guns mean big business in America. The industry employs more than 300,000 people, pays roughly $15.4 billion in wages a year and has an overall impact of $51.4 billion on the U.S. economy as of 2017, according to the National Sports Shooting Foundation
    (NSSF).
  </p>

  <p>“Our industry is proud to be one of the truly bright spots in our economy as an unprecedented number of Americans have chosen to exercise their fundamental right to keep and bear arms and to safely enjoy the shooting sports,” said Stephen L. Sanetti,
    NSSF president and CEO, in a statement.
  </p>

  <p>That “bright spot” doesn’t appear to be in decline, data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) reveal.</p>

  <p>In 2016, U.S. gun makers made history and reported manufacturing nearly 11.5 million firearms, up from the previous record of 10.3 million in 2013. That's the equivalent of more than 30,000 guns a day — enough for 1 out of 25 Americans to receive one.

  <p>The millions of guns America produces every year raises key questions: Where are these guns made, where are they sold and how much money and how many jobs do they contribute to the economy? We can answer these questions through a combination of data
    from the NSSF, ATF, the FBI’s NICS background check system and the U.S. Census Bureau.
  </p>

  <h1>WHERE ARE GUNS MADE?</h1>

  <p>America’s century-old gun industry has its origins in the northeast, where nine states now churn out more than half of the nation’s firearms every year, according to the ATF.</p>

  <p>Thirteen years before the American Civil War in 1852, Horace Smith and Daniel Baird Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in Massachusetts to make pistols and rifles that could repeatedly fire a fully self-contained cartridge. They won a patent
    two years later in 1854, company records show.
  </p>

  <p>In 1857, the inventors set up a shop in Springfield, Massachusetts and sold their first pistol for $12. Today, Smith & Wesson runs America’s largest gun factory in Springfield, which single-handedly produced 2.1 million of the 2.5 million firearms Massachusetts
    manufactured in 2016.
  </p>

  <p>Massachusetts now supplies one-fifth of all firearms nationwide thanks mostly to the factory, edging out every other state by at least ten percent.</p>

  <p>In more than a dozen mid-sized cities and towns like Springfield across the northeast, gun factories are a source of blue-collar, often unionized jobs which haven’t departed for shores with cheaper labor.</p>

  <p>The NSSF estimates that gun manufacturing in Massachusetts employed nearly 500 people, paid close to $24 million in wages and contributed $197 million to the state’s economy.</p>

  <p>Massachusetts delivered nearly three-fifths of the guns from the northeast, but it also had help from its neighbors.</p>

  <p>Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Maine and Vermont together supplied more than 2.6 million firearms or 24 percent of the national total.</p>

  <p>Across the northeast, gun manufacturing employed more than 1,900 people, paid more than $146 million in wages and contributed nearly $752 million to the economy, according to the NSSF.</p>

  <p>Among America’s 100 top gun manufacturing cities in 2016, which accounted for 93% of all manufacturing, 22 cities are in the northeast.</p>
